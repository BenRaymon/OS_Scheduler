To compile the program run `make os` in the top level directory of the project. 

Run the program with `./os 1 input.txt` where `input.txt` is the name of the file with the input events. Ensure the input file is in the same directory as the executable.  

Note: This project was programmed in C to be run on Windows. Imports may have to be changed sligthly to run on a different OS.
